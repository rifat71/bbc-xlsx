In this project you will find two js file which will act accordingly:

test.js - Write data, Read data, Edit data in xlsx file.

test2.js - After running the test2.js file, the output will be an xlsx file. Which will contain all the titles, detailed descriptions, and links from the BBC home page. The test will run automatically after every five minutes. There are two ways (timeout interval and nested timeout) to solve this in javascript. Here I use the nested timeout method. For the first time, the program will generate an xlsx file. After that, in every run, a new sheet will generate under that xlsx file and store all the desired information in that sheet accordingly.
